Examples include `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, and `__eq__`. These methods allow instances of the class to interact with Python's built-in functions and operators. For example, the `__str__` method is used to define the string representation of an object, which is what gets printed when you use the `print()` function on an instance of the class."
